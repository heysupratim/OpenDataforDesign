          <p class="paragraph">"Ethics for design" team published this template for deconstructing artifacts and
            understanding the reasons for the construct of any given design. I particularly applaud their efforts of
            breaking down this process into simple questions that answer what a product is, how it looks, what is the
            natural outcome of the design and most importantly what the designer's worldview was while designing the
            product or service. They also ask you to characterize the designer's viewpoint of a 'good life' which is
            often revealing of their choices and principles.

          <p class="paragraph">Microsoft design team published this primer for recognizing and correcting for exclusion
            introduced by AI. Out of the 5 categories of biases that are presented here, the dataset bias brings out the
            major problem at hand - Lack of diversity in our training data. Another bias called the association bias
            assumes human-induced cultural assumptions to trickle down into our ML models. Gaining customer insights
            early on can reduce the risk of high-risk exclusion. Finally, adopt privacy by design and not
            privacy-by-reaction.

          <p class="paragraph">Humanetech built this worksheet that allows you to identify avenues for
            improving your product. Specifically, to make it more transformative for the humans using them. They
            introduce this concept of human sensitivities which are instincts that get affected by any technology. An
            example is emotional sensitivity wherein elements of constant monitoring in your app might induce stress in
            your users. I think this worksheet is a great for post-release reflection by the team.

          <p class="paragraph">Instead of focusing on the use of technology in upgrading the built environment, this
            playbook tries to unfurl the issues of alienating the public from design decisions of a smart city. The
            playbook discusses way that the civic engagement can happen in the design of an urban smart city. Out of the
            5 broad themes that they present, the two that stood out to me were, Infusing creativity in the
            specifications of an urban landscape and second, to constantly question the data, its source and its purpose

          <h1 class="heading-2">Inclusive Design Toolkit</h1>
          <p class="paragraph">This guide from Microsoft suggests the use of diversity in human abilities as a resource
            for design. The assumption that every user is as abled as the designer is a flawed viewpoint. If the
            baseline for any product is considering the designer as a normal, then it leads to exclusion. I really
            respct the wordview that disability is not a physical condiction rather a mismatched human interaction with
            the society. The best learning that comes with this guide is how designing specifically for one can extend
            benefits to many.</p>

            explores some newer business models, material choices and packaging techniques to increase sustainble use of
            industrial consumer goods. Some of my personal favorite sections were broadening product use cases to
            increase versatility of a product, accomodating for diverse audience from a single design, green design and
            designing for disassembly.</p>
